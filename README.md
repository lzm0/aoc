# Advent of Code in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, written in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

## Project Structure

- `src/bin/` contains the solutions and unit tests for each day, for any years that I have completed.
- `src/input/` contains the input files for each day.

## Usage

To run the solutions for a given day, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin <year>-<day>
```

To run the tests:

```bash
cargo test --bin <year>-<day>
```
